### Overview

Welcome, and thank you for taking part in this study procedure! This study introduces a stand-alone electro-acoustic instrument, coined Brave. Brave is a physical framework, allowing artists to interact directly with neural networks to produce sound.

A neural network is a specific type of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The architecture emulates the human brain - neurons are modelled by “nodes”, and neural connections are replaced by “weights”. A generative neural network learns how to reproduce the training dataset. This is done by an iterative process where training data is passed into the model, the results are analysed, and the weights and biases are adjusted accordingly. This is known as the ”training process".

Here, you are given a model trained on the sounds of a darbouka - a traditional percussive instrument of  Egyptian descent. On the screen, you can see the individual “weights” between the neurons. The y-axis represents the magnitude of their value.

Neural networks are composed of individual layers of neurons - to slide between these layers, use encoder 1. To displace these weights, sliding values to neighbouring neurons, use encoder 2. Encoder 3 allows the user to add a bias to all neurons in the respective layers - for example, the weights of all neurons present in the layer could be increased by 0.1. A scaling factor can be applied to all neuron weights via encoder 4. Encoder 5 allows the user to tweak volume to taste. Finally, a short tap of the button switch resets the current layer, and a longer tap resets the entire model.

Generative AI has pushed the boundaries of artistic creation - it can automate laborious aspects of the artistic process, act as an initial idea generator, and democratise expression. However, this technology bears a critical downside, in that it is homogenising the cultural landscape. In response,  Brave takes a generative audio synthesis model, and exposes the internal architecture to the artist. The device seeks to explore how neural network manipulation techniques, known as “network-bending”, can be used creatively. How can you make the model misbehave? How do changing the neurons “weights” change the quality of the sound?
